      <h2>About Kati</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! My name is Katherine, and I go by Kati! I am from Connecticut, but I 
        now live in New Hampshire! I love all things math and science, which is why I 
        studied meteorology in college. I love to travel, hiking, baking, and I adore my
        two cats!
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Obtained by Bachelors of Science in Meteorology from
        Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
        I originally moved to Daytona Beach to pursue a career in aviation, but
        quickly fell in love with meteorology. I went on to graduate a semester
        early from my undergraduate program in December 2025. <br>In my senior year of 
        college, I began taking classes through NHTI to obtain my teaching certificate. 
        I am still working on my certificate, as I work as a substitute teacher.

      <h2>Employment</h2>
      <p>
        Worked as a barista throughout college, before shifting to research
        assistant roles in meteorology and climate science. I went on to work as a tutor
        and T.A. and I quickly fell in love with teaching.
